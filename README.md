#ToggleMuteBotInDiscord

**AutoHotkey must be installed (Written on Version 1.1.33.02)**

I personally use this with my StreamDeck which has a toggle function for a button, when click it alternates between pressing Ctrl-Alt-M and Ctrl-Alt-U. This fires the script (or exe) which finds discord by the exe name, switched to it, sends .m or .u in whatever chate window is currently open, and switches to the previous program.
